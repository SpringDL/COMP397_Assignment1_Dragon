                <p>You find yourself in a room with no windows, doors, or any clear way of entry into and out of the room for that matter. The room is entirely empty save for a wombat sleeping on a small radiator in the South-East corner of the room.</p>

                <p>You vigorously stretch your arms and legs as you prepare for the arduous task of dropkicking the wombat off the Radiator. With a ferocious roar, you leap across the room and dropkick the wombat sleeping on top of the radiator. The wombat is sent flying and ricochets off of the wall and then the ceiling before proceeding to slam into the dead centre of the room's floor. The wombat shatters into 6 different pieces to reveal a novelty can of paper snakes, a notebook, an old hourglass, and a paperclip. It turns out the wombat looking thing was just a hollow pinata.</p>

                <p>For reasons unknown, you decide that it would be in your best interest to lick the radiator. You crouch down next to the radiator and tap it with the tip of your tongue. You consider for a second the possibilities of opening a new bank acount at CHS Banking before you brush it off as a bad idea. You lick the radiator with a satisfying slurp. It tastes of Bacon. You are hesitant at first, but eventually you decide to press your tongue against the radiator. As you plunge into a state of ecstacy over the overwhelming flavours of bacon, the wonbat catches the alluring scent of your tongue cooking against the radiator and awakes from its slumber. The wombat unleashes a wide yawn before it hops onto and off of your head and knocking you back. It lunges towards your tongue and latches on with it's teeth like a snapping turtle.</p>
